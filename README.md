# Email-Bomber
Email bombs are a type of Denial of Service (DoS) attack. Victims face an uncontrollable deluge of messages quickly filling up their inbox when the attack begins. With enough volume, the attack renders the victims mailbox useless. Though it is not an accident.
When senders intentionally attempt to overwhelm a mail server by sending a large volume of messages in a short period, it is known as mail bombing or list bombing. The impact of mail bombing can be severe, ranging from filling up the disk space of the mail server to causing the server to crash.![image](https://github.com/Aditya-Chopra30/Email-Bomber/assets/110564061/4811510c-5055-49c6-8ddd-129e8c058515)
